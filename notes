Xrepo acme-cms
Xadd db.js file
create the model which will get the code below to work as expected <---WORKING ON THIS
(note the hierarchy method is tricky and you don't need it for the routes)
add server.js file
add route for /api/pages which will return all pages
add route for /api/pages/:id/children which will return the child pages for a page with passed in id
add route for /api/pages/:id/siblings which will return the siblings for a given passed in id
