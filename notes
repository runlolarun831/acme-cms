Xrepo acme-cms
Xadd db.js file
Xcreate the model which will get the code below to work as expected
(note the hierarchy method is tricky and you don't need it for the routes)<---WORKING ON THIS
add server.js file
add route for /api/pages which will return all pages
add route for /api/pages/:id/children which will return the child pages for a page with passed in id
add route for /api/pages/:id/siblings which will return the siblings for a given passed in id



Prof notes- no react

just express and sequelize
